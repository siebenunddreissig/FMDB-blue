# FMDB-blue
 Built-in Log and Undo Engine for FileMaker Database

## Outline  
  FMDB-blue is a system for log management, infinite undo and redo, embedded in an existing FileMaker database.  
  FMDB-blue_Processor.fmp12 is responsible for logging, undo, and redo. This file itself does not store any log data. You can view the log data, but you cannot check the actual operation of the system from this file alone.    
  To see what you can do with this system, try running the sample file from the link described in "How to Use".
